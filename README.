## 📈 Learning Roadmap & Progress

I approach learning Python in a structured, modular way, ensuring that theoretical knowledge is immediately applied and documented.

### Phase 1: Core Programming Fundamentals (In Progress)

This phase establishes the foundational logic necessary for any programming language.

| Folder | Core Concepts Covered | Key Achievements |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01\_Python\_Basics** | Variables, Data Types, Input/Output, Conditional Statements (`if/elif/else`). | Successfully implemented decision-making logic and basic data handling. |
| **02\_Control\_Flow** | Loops (`while/for`), Functions (`def`), and Parameters. | Built reusable functions and automated repetitive tasks. |
| **03\_Data\_Structures** | (Future) Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries. | *(Planned)* |

### Phase 2: Application & Web Development

| Folder | Focus Technology | Output Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **04\_Web\_Basics** | HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Fundamentals). | *(Planned: First static web page)* |
| **05\_Flask\_Projects** | Python Flask Framework. | *(Planned: Personal Portfolio Website hosted on GitHub)* |

## 🛠️ Tools & Methodology

I use a professional methodology to manage my code and document my progress.

* **Version Control System (VCS):** Git
* **Hosting Platform:** GitHub
* **Methodology:** Every lesson is documented with a dedicated, commented `.py` file, committed with a detailed log message.

***

*Thank you for reviewing my progress. I am committed to continuous learning and application.*
